---

## PART 1: INTRODUCTION (~1 minute)

### Opening (30 seconds)

> "Good morning/afternoon. Thank you for taking the time to see Bideval in action.
>
> Today, I'll show you how we're transforming the way procurement teams evaluate vendor proposals—turning weeks of manual work into hours of automated, data-driven decision-making."

### The Problem (15 seconds)

> "Every RFQ process shares the same challenges: dozens of documents to review, inconsistent evaluation criteria across team members, and the constant pressure to make the right vendor decision—fast.
>
> Traditional spreadsheet-based comparisons are slow, error-prone, and don't scale."

### The Solution (15 seconds)

> "Bideval solves this. It's an AI-powered platform that processes your RFQ documents and vendor proposals, automatically extracts requirements, evaluates compliance, and delivers a ranked recommendation—with full transparency into *why* each vendor scored the way they did.
>
> Let me show you exactly how it works."

---

## PART 2: LIVE DEMO (~9 minutes)

### 2.1 RFQ Document Upload (~1.5 minutes)

> "Everything starts with your RFQ. In this case, we're working with a hydrogen production plant project."

**[Navigate to Upload page → RFQ Base tab]**

> "Here I can upload the customer's RFQ documents. The system accepts multiple file formats—PDF is the most common. Simply drag and drop, or click to select."

**[Upload a sample RFQ document]**

> "What happens behind the scenes is powerful: our AI extracts every technical requirement, commercial condition, and deliverable specification from the document. This becomes the baseline against which all vendor proposals will be evaluated.
>
> The beauty is that you upload once, and the system maintains consistency across all evaluations. No more different team members interpreting requirements differently."

---

### 2.2 Vendor Proposal Upload (~1.5 minutes)

**[Switch to Proposals tab]**

> "Now, let's process the vendor proposals. This is where Bideval really shines.
>
> I select the project, choose the vendor—let's say IDOM—and specify what type of evaluation this document contains: technical, economical, or deliverables."

**[Select provider and evaluation types, then upload proposal]**

> "Watch the progress ring here. The system is now:
> - Extracting text from the PDF using OCR
> - Automatically classifying the provider and document type
> - Generating semantic embeddings for intelligent matching
> - Evaluating each response against your RFQ requirements
>
> This entire process—which would take a procurement specialist hours or even days—completes in minutes. And it's consistent. Every proposal is evaluated against the exact same criteria."

**[Show the progress completing]**

> "We can process multiple vendors in parallel. While IDOM is processing, I could start uploading SENER, Técnicas Reunidas, or any other vendor. The system handles up to 7 vendors simultaneously."

---

### 2.3 Requirements Table & Gap Analysis (~1.5 minutes)

**[Navigate to Results page]**

> "Here's where we see the structured output. Every RFQ requirement is now a row in this table, and for each vendor, we have their corresponding response and evaluation."

**[Apply filters to show specific evaluation type]**

> "I can filter by project, evaluation type, phase, or specific vendor. Let's filter for technical evaluation only.
>
> Notice this column structure—each provider has their own response column. This makes side-by-side comparison immediate.
>
> But more importantly, look at these gaps."

**[Point to rows with missing or incomplete vendor responses]**

> "Where you see incomplete responses or items marked with lower scores, those are gaps—areas where a vendor hasn't fully addressed your requirements. These become the basis for clarification questions.
>
> And of course, you can export this entire analysis to Excel for your internal reporting or stakeholder presentations."

**[Click Export → Excel]**

---

### 2.4 Automatic Q&A Generation (~1 minute)

**[Navigate to Q&A page]**

> "This is one of our most valued features: automatic technical audit question generation.
>
> Based on the gaps and ambiguities the AI detected during evaluation, the system generates targeted clarification questions—organized by technical discipline."

**[Show questions grouped by discipline]**

> "Each question has an importance level, a status tracker, and a field for vendor responses. You can approve, edit, or regenerate questions as needed.
>
> What used to take your technical team a full day of document review now happens automatically. And the questions are specific—they reference exactly where the gap exists in the vendor's proposal."

---

### 2.5 Email Generation to Vendors (~1 minute)

**[Navigate to Mail page]**

> "Once you have your clarification questions, you need to communicate with vendors. This is our email generation module."

**[Select a provider and tone]**

> "I select the vendor, choose the tone—formal for this European context—and select which issues or questions I want to address."

**[Generate email]**

> "The AI drafts a professional email that references specific proposal sections and asks clear questions. You can preview, edit, and then copy it directly to your email client.
>
> The consistency here is key—every vendor receives the same level of professionalism and clarity."

---

### 2.6 AI Chat for Deep Dives (~1 minute)

**[Navigate to Chat page]**

> "Sometimes you need to ask specific questions that don't fit a standard report. That's what our AI chat is for."

**[Type a question: "Which vendor offers the best hydrogen purity guarantees?"]**

> "I can ask natural language questions like: 'Which vendor offers the best hydrogen purity guarantees?' or 'Compare CAPEX estimates across all vendors.'
>
> The AI searches across all uploaded documents—RFQ and proposals—and provides a synthesized answer with references. It's like having an analyst who has read every single page of every document."

**[Show the response streaming]**

> "This is particularly valuable for executive briefings or when stakeholders ask unexpected questions during decision meetings."

---

### 2.7 Vendor Scoring & Weights (~1 minute)

**[Navigate to Decision Dashboard → Scoring Matrix tab]**

> "Now let's talk about the scoring methodology—this is the heart of objective vendor evaluation.
>
> We use a weighted 12-criterion model across four categories:
> - **Technical** at 40%: efficiency, degradation rates, flexibility, purity
> - **Economic** at 30%: CAPEX, OPEX, warranties
> - **Execution** at 20%: delivery time, track record, organizational strength
> - **HSE/ESG** at 10%: safety compliance and sustainability
>
> Each vendor is scored 0-10 on every criterion, and the weights calculate an overall score automatically."

**[Show the matrix with vendor scores]**

> "This matrix shows exactly where each vendor excels and where they fall short. No guesswork—pure data."

---

### 2.8 Final Comparison & Recommendation (~1.5 minutes)

**[Switch to Executive View tab]**

> "Finally, the executive summary. This is what your leadership team wants to see.
>
> At the top: the recommended vendor—in this case, let's say IDOM with a score of 8.7 out of 10.
>
> Below that: the runner-up and the score gap. Then, a clear breakdown of strengths and weaknesses for the top performer."

**[Point to the radar chart and category breakdown]**

> "This radar chart visualizes the winner's profile across all four categories. At a glance, decision-makers can see that IDOM leads in technical capability but may have a slightly higher CAPEX.
>
> And here's the key: the system doesn't just tell you *who* won—it tells you *why*. Full transparency into the scoring logic. This is essential for audit trails and stakeholder buy-in.
>
> You can export this entire dashboard for board presentations, and every scoring decision is fully documented."

---

## CLOSING (~30 seconds)

> "To summarize what you've seen:
>
> - **Upload** your RFQ and vendor proposals in minutes
> - **Automate** requirement extraction and compliance evaluation
> - **Identify** gaps and generate clarification questions automatically
> - **Score** vendors objectively with a transparent, weighted methodology
> - **Decide** with confidence, backed by data and clear recommendations
>
> We're reducing weeks of manual work to hours—with 98.5% accuracy and full audit traceability.
>
> I'd be happy to answer any questions, or if you'd like, we can discuss how Bideval would integrate with your current procurement workflow."
